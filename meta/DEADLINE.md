## Part 1: App Description

    The game that I decided to build was snake. The main controls on the game are the different arrows on the keyboard
    and the spacebar to restart the game.

## Part 2: New

    While working on this project I learned more about javafx and threads and using a timer.
    I also learned how to accept inputs from the keyboard for the game.

## Part 3: Retrospect

    If i were to start again from scratch I would make sure to create separate methods for each of the commands.
    At first I tried doing it all on one method but that was very hard to work with and caused many mistakes.
    It was easier to debug and create with multiple methods so that would have saved me a lot of time.
